**Bio:**  
Hello! I'm Palash Thakur, a passionate data scientist with a keen interest in the intersection of healthcare and technology. Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working extensively with the UMLS dataset while contributing to the I2B2 model at Harvard Medical School. My journey in healthcare technology also includes my time at the Healthcare Information Exchange in Austin, Texas, where I worked on  solutions to streamline healthcare data.

This tool is a product of my experience and passion, designed to make medical data analysis and accessibility easier for researchers, developers, and healthcare professionals. I hope you find it as useful as I intended it to be!
